Provided webots is previously downloaded on your machine, you can run this project. After unzipping the project, open the folder titled worlds and open the world titled assignment-1-jasa6380.wbt. This will then open the world. From there, the robot should complete a series of movements instructed by the user in the controller module. If the assignment is not imported properly, the code can also be viewed elsewhere in this repository, labeled my_controller.py.
